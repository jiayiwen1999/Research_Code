Permutation Updated
To create a permutation, call Permutation(a), where a is an array representing the oneline notation of a permutation

Method in Permutation: 
Let a be a Permutation. 
a.evaluate(i) returns the image of i under a.
a.inversion() return # of inversion of a.
a.act(i) returns a new permutation obtained from acting a by s_i, where s_i is the adjacent transposition (i,i+1)
a.generate_word() gives a list of all reduced word for a.
