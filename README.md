Permutation Updated<br />
To create a permutation, call Permutation(a), where a is an array representing the oneline notation of a permutation<br />

Method in Permutation: <br />
Let a be a Permutation. <br />
a.evaluate(i) returns the image of i under a.<br />
a.inversion() return # of inversion of a.<br />
a.act(i) returns a new permutation obtained from acting a by s_i, where s_i is the adjacent transposition (i,i+1).<br />
a.generate_word() gives a list of all reduced word for a.<br />
